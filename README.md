# @ggamel gets dotty with it

## What?

Greg Gamel's dotfiles. These help me surf the waves of the internet with more ease. Much has been borrowed from @pengwynn, @holman, and @adamyonk (who borrowed much from other smart folks).

## How?

I'll be trying to routinely commit my changes to reflect my current dotfiles. Basically, I'm using ZSH and trying to make my term as efficient and awesome as possible.

## Install!?

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ggamel/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
script/bootstrap
```
