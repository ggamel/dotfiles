# What?
Greg Gamel's dotfiles. These are largely borrowed from @pengwynn and @holman, who likely borrowed much from other smart folks.

# How?
I'll be trying to continously commit my changes to reflect my current dotfiles. Basically, I'm using ZSH and trying to make my term as efficient and awesome as possible.
